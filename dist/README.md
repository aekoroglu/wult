This directory contains wult packaging data.

1. rpm - wult RPM packaging example. This is not used "as-is" for any specific distribution, this is
   more of an example. Distributions like Fedora and CentOS have own spec file in the build system.
   But we try to keep them in sync with Fedora's spec file.

2. Debian - we did not verify it for long time, and it is probably very out of date. Contributions
   are very welcome.
