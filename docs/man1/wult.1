This command exists for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. Please, do not use for other reasons. keep in mind that if the the specified 'devid' device was bound to some driver (e.g., a network driver), it will be unbinded and with
this option It won't be binded back.

.TP
\fB\-\-force\fR
By default wult refuses to load network card drivers if its Linux network interface is in an active state, such as "up". Use '\-\-force' to disable this safety mechanism. Use '\-\-force' option with caution.

Name of the host to run on (default is the local host).

.TP
\fB\-U\fR USERNAME, \fB\-\-username\fR USERNAME
Name of the user to use for logging into the remote host over SSH. The default user name is 'root'.

.TP
\fB\-K\fR \fI\,PRIVKEY\/\fR, \fB\-\-priv\-key\fR \fI\,PRIVKEY\/\fR

.TP
\fB\-T\fR \fI\,TIMEOUT\/\fR, \fB\-\-timeout\fR \fI\,TIMEOUT\/\fR
SSH connect timeout in seconds, default is 8.

.TP
\fB\-c\fR COUNT, \fB\-\-datapoints\fR COUNT
How many datapoints should the test result include, default is 1000000. Note, unless the '\-\-start\-over' option is used, the pre\-existing datapoints are taken into account. For example, if the test result already has 6000 datapoints and
'\-c 10000' is used, the tool will collect 4000 datapoints and exit. Warning: collecting too many datapoints may result in a very large test result file, which will be difficult to process later, because that would require a lot of
memory.

.TP
\fB\-\-time\-limit\fR LIMIT
The measurement time limit, i.e., for how long the SUT should be measured. The default unit is minutes, but you can use the following handy specifiers as well: d \- days, h \- hours, m \- minutes, s \- seconds. For example '1h25m' would be
1 hour and 25 minutes, or 10m5s would be 10 minutes and 5 seconds. Value '0' means "no time limit", and this is the default. If this option is used along with the '\-\-datapoints' option, then measurements will stop as when either the
time limit is reached, or the required amount of datapoints is collected.

.TP
\fB\-\-start\-over\fR
If the output directory already contains the datapoints CSV file with some amount of datapoints in it, the default behavior is to keep them and append more datapoints if necessary. But with this option all the pre\-existing datapoints
will be removed as soon as the tool starts writing new datapoints.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR, \fB\-\-outdir\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR
Path to the directory to store the results at.

.TP
\fB\-\-reportid\fR \fI\,REPORTID\/\fR
Any string which may serve as an identifier of this run. By default report ID is the current date, prefixed with the remote host name in case the '\-H' option was used: [hostname\-]YYYYMMDD. For example, "20150323" is a report ID for a
run made on March 23, 2015. The allowed characters are: ACSII alphanumeric, '\-', '.', ',', '_', '~', and ':'.

.TP
\fB\-\-stats\fR \fI\,STATS\/\fR
Comma\-separated list of statistics to collect. The statistics are collected in parallel with measuring C\-state latency. They are stored in the the "stats" sub\-directory of the output directory. By default, only 'sysinfo' statistics are
collected. Use 'all' to collect all possible statistics. Use '\-\-stats=""' or \-\-stats='none' to disable statistics collection. If you know exactly what statistics you need, specify the comma\-separated list of statistics to collect. For
example, use 'turbostat,acpower' if you need only turbostat and AC power meter statistics. You can also specify the statistics you do not want to be collected by pre\-pending the '!' symbol. For example, 'all,!turbostat' would mean:
collect all the statistics supported by the SUT, except for 'turbostat'. Use the '\-\-list\-stats' option to get more information about available statistics. By default, only 'sysinfo' statistics are collected.

.TP
\fB\-\-stats\-intervals\fR \fI\,STATS_INTERVALS\/\fR
The intervals for statistics. Statistics collection is based on doing periodic snapshots of data. For example, by default the 'acpower' statistics collector reads SUT power consumption for the last second every second, and 'turbostat'
default interval is 5 seconds. Use 'acpower:5,turbostat:10' to increase the intervals to 5 and 10 seconds correspondingly. Use the '\-\-list\-stats' to get the default interval values.

.TP
\fB\-\-list\-stats\fR
Print information about the statistics 'wult' can collect and exit.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fI\,LDIST\/\fR, \fB\-\-ldist\fR \fI\,LDIST\/\fR
This tool works by scheduling a delayed event, then sleeping and waiting for it to happen. This step is referred to as a "measurement cycle" and it is usually repeated many times. The launch distance defines how far in the future the
delayed event is sceduled. By default this tool randomly selects launch distance within a range. The default range is [0,4ms], but you can override it with this option. Specify a comma\-separated range (e.g '\-\-ldist 10,5000'), or a
single value if you want launch distance to be precisely that value all the time. The default unit is microseconds, but you can use the following specifiers as well: ms \- milliseconds, us \- microseconds, ns \- nanoseconds. For example, '
\-\-ldist 10us,5ms' would be a [10,5000] microseconds range. Too small values may cause failures or prevent the SUT from reaching deep C\-states. If the range starts with 0, the minimum possible launch distance value allowed by the delayed
event source will be used. The optimal launch distance range is system\-specific.

.TP
\fB\-\-cpunum\fR \fI\,CPUNUM\/\fR
The logical CPU number to measure, default is CPU 0.

.TP
\fB\-\-no\-unload\fR
This option exists for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. Please, do not use for other reasons. While normally wult kernel modules are unloaded after the measurements are done, with this option the modules will stay loaded into the
kernel. Keep in mind that if the the specified 'devid' device was bound to some driver (e.g., a network driver), it will be unbinded and with this option it won't be binded back.

.TP
\fB\-\-post\-trigger\fR POST_TRIGGER
The post\-measurement trigger. Please, provide path to a trigger program that should be executed after a datapoint had been collected. The next measurement cycle will start only after the trigger program finishes. The trigger program
will be executed as 'POST_TRIGGER \-\-value <value>', where '<value>' is the last observed wake latency in nanoseconds. This option exists for debugging and troubleshooting purposes only.

.TP
\fB\-\-post\-trigger\-range\fR TRANGE
By default, the post trigger is executed for every datapoint, but this option allows for setting the wake latency range \- the trigger program will be executed only when observed wake latency value is in the range (inclusive). Specify a
comma\-separated range, e.g '\-\-post\-trigger\-range 50,600'. The default unit is microseconds, but you can use the following specifiers as well: ms \- milliseconds, us \- microseconds, ns \- nanoseconds. For example, '\-\-post\-trigger\-range
100us,1ms' would be a [100,1000] microseconds range.

.TP
\fB\-\-report\fR
Generate an HTML report for collected results (same as calling 'report' command with default arguments).

.TP
\fB\-\-force\fR
By default wult does not accept network card as a measurement device if its Linux network interface is in an active state, such as "up". Use '\-\-force' to disable this safety mechanism. Use '\-\-force' option with caution.

.SH OPTIONS 'wult report'
usage: wult report [-h] [-q] [-d] [-o OUTDIR] [--rfilt RFILT] [--rsel RSEL] [--even-up-dp-count] [-x XAXES] [-y YAXES] [--hist HIST] [--chist CHIST] [--reportids REPORTIDS] [--title-descr TITLE_DESCR] [--relocatable] [--list-columns]

Print debugging information.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR, \fB\-\-outdir\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR
Path to the directory to store the report at. By default the report is stored in the 'wult\-report\-<reportid>' sub\-directory of the current working directory, where '<reportid>' is report ID of wult test result (the first one if there
are multiple).

.TP
\fB\-\-rfilt\fR \fI\,RFILT\/\fR
The row filter: remove all the rows satisfying the filter expression. Here is an example of an expression: '(WakeLatency < 10000) | (PC6% < 1)'. This row filter expression will remove all rows with 'WakeLatency' smaller than 10000
nanoseconds or package C6 residency smaller than 1%. The detailed row filter expression syntax can be found in the documentation for the 'eval()' function of Python 'pandas' module. You can use column names in the expression, or the
special word 'index' for the row number. Value '0' is the header, value '1' is the first row, and so on. For example, expression 'index >= 10' will get rid of all data rows except for the first 10 ones.

.TP
\fB\-\-rsel\fR \fI\,RSEL\/\fR
The row selector: remove all rows except for those satisfying the selector expression. In other words, the selector is just an inverse filter: '\-\-rsel expr' is the same as '\-\-rfilt "not (expr)"'.

.TP
\fB\-\-even\-up\-dp\-count\fR
Even up datapoints count before generating the report. This option is useful when generating a report for many test results (a diff). If the test results contain different count of datapoints (rows count in the CSV file), the resulting
histograms may look a little bit misleading. This option evens up datapoints count in the test results. It just finds the test result with the minimum count of datapoints and ignores the extra datapoints in the other test results.

.TP
\fB\-x\fR \fI\,XAXES\/\fR, \fB\-\-xaxes\fR \fI\,XAXES\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of CSV column names (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to use on X\-axes, default is 'SilentTime'. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names.

.TP
\fB\-y\fR \fI\,YAXES\/\fR, \fB\-\-yaxes\fR \fI\,YAXES\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of CSV column names (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to use on the Y\-axes. If multiple CSV column names are specified for the X\- or Y\-axes, then the report will include all the X\- and
Y\-axes combination. The default is '.*Latency,.*Delay'. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names.

.TP
\fB\-\-hist\fR \fI\,HIST\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of CSV column names (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to add a histogram for, default is '.*Latency,.*Delay'. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names. Use value
'none' to disable histograms.

.TP
\fB\-\-chist\fR \fI\,CHIST\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of CSV column names (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to add a cumulative distribution for, default is '.*Latency'. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names. Use
value 'none' to disable cumulative histograms.

.TP
\fB\-\-reportids\fR \fI\,REPORTIDS\/\fR
Every input raw result comes with a report ID. This report ID is basically a short name for the test result, and it used in the HTML report to refer to the test result. However, sometimes it is helpful to temporarily override the report
IDs just for the HTML report, and this is what the '\-\-reportids' option does. Please, specify a comma\-separated list of report IDs for every input raw test result. The first report ID will be used for the first raw rest result, the
second report ID will be used for the second raw test result, and so on. Please, refer to the '\-\-reportid' option description in the 'start' command for more information about the report ID.

.TP
\fB\-\-title\-descr\fR \fI\,TITLE_DESCR\/\fR
The report title description \- any text describing this report as whole, or path to a file containing the overall report description. For example, if the report compares platform A and platform B, the description could be something like
'platform A vs B comparison'. This text will be included into the very beginning of the resulting HTML report.

.TP
\fB\-\-relocatable\fR
The generated report includes references to the test results. By default, these references are symlinks to the raw result directories. However, this makes the generated report be not relocatable. Use this option to make the report
relocatable in expense of increased disk space consumption \- this tool will make a copy of the test results.

.TP
\fB\-\-list\-columns\fR
Print the list of the available column names and exit.

.SH OPTIONS 'wult filter'

.TP
\fB\-\-cfilt\fR \fI\,CFILT\/\fR
The columns filter: remove all column specified in the filter. The columns filter is just a comma\-separated list of the CSV file column names or python style regular expressions matching the names. For example expression
