.SH OPTIONS 'wult deploy'
usage: wult deploy [-h] [-q] [-d] [--kernel-src KSRC] [-H HOSTNAME] [-U USERNAME] [-K PRIVKEY] [-T TIMEOUT]

Compile and deploy wult helpers and drivers to the SUT (System Under Test), which can be either local or a remote host, depending on the '\-H' option.The drivers are searched for in the following directories (and in the following order) on the local host: /usr/bin/drivers/idle, $WULT_DATA_PATH/drivers/idle (if 'WULT_DATA_PATH' environment variable is defined), $HOME/.local/share/wult/drivers/idle, /usr/local/share/wult/drivers/idle, /usr/share/wult/drivers/idle.The wult tool also depends on the following helpers: stats\-collect. These helpers will be compiled on the SUT and deployed to the SUT. The sources of the helpers are searched for in the following paths (and in the following order) on the local host: /usr/bin/helpers, $WULT_DATA_PATH/helpers (if 'WULT_DATA_PATH' environment variable is defined), $HOME/.local/share/wult/helpers, /usr/local/share/wult/helpers, /usr/share/wult/helpers. By default, helpers are deployed to the path defined by the WULT_HELPERSPATH environment variable. If the variable is not defined, helpers are deployed to '$HOME/.local/bin', where '$HOME' is the home directory of user 'USERNAME' on host 'HOST' (see '\-\-host' and '\-\-username' options).

SSH connect timeout in seconds, default is 8.

.TP
\fB\-c\fR COUNT, \fB\-\-datapoints\fR COUNT
How many datapoints should the test result include, default is 1000000. Note, unless the '\-\-start\-over' option is used, the pre\-existing datapoints are taken into account. For example, if the test result already has 6000 datapoints and
'\-c 10000' is used, the tool will collect 4000 datapoints and exit. Warning: collecting too many datapoints may result in a very large test result file, which will be difficult to process later, because that would require a lot of
memory.

.TP
\fB\-\-time\-limit\fR LIMIT
The measurement time limit, i.e., for how long the SUT should be measured. The default unit is minutes, but you can use the following handy specifiers as well: d \- days, h \- hours, m \- minutes, s \- seconds. For example '1h25m' would be
1 hour and 25 minutes, or 10m5s would be 10 minutes and 5 seconds. Value '0' means "no time limit", and this is the default. If this option is used along with the '\-\-datapoints' option, then measurements will stop as when either the
time limit is reached, or the required amount of datapoints is collected.

.TP
\fB\-\-rfilt\fR \fI\,RFILT\/\fR
The row filter: remove all the rows satisfying the filter expression. Here is an example of an expression: '(WakeLatency < 10000) | (PC6% < 1)'. This row filter expression will remove all rows with 'WakeLatency' smaller than 10000
nanoseconds or package C6 residency smaller than 1%. You can use any column names in the expression.

.TP
\fB\-\-rsel\fR \fI\,RSEL\/\fR
The row selector: remove all rows except for those satisfying the selector expression. In other words, the selector is just an inverse filter: '\-\-rsel expr' is the same as '\-\-rfilt "not (expr)"'.

.TP
\fB\-\-keep\-filtered\fR
If the '\-\-rfilt' / '\-\-rsel' options are used, then the datapoints not matching the selector or matching the filter are discarded. This is the default behavior which can be changed with this option. If '\-\-keep\-filtered' has been
specified, then all datapoints are saved in result. Here is an example. Suppose you want to collect 100000 datapoints where PC6 residency is greater than 0. In this case, you can use these options: \-c 100000 \-\-rfilt="PC6% == 0". The
result will contain 100000 datapoints, all of them will have non\-zero PC6 residency. But what if you do not want to simply discard the other datapoints, because they are also interesting? Well, add the '\-\-keep\-filtered' option. The
result will contain, say, 150000 datapoints, 100000 of which will have non\-zero PC6 residency.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR, \fB\-\-outdir\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR
Path to the directory to store the results at.

.TP
\fB\-\-reportid\fR \fI\,REPORTID\/\fR
Any string which may serve as an identifier of this run. By default report ID is the current date, prefixed with the remote host name in case the '\-H' option was used: [hostname\-]YYYYMMDD. For example, "20150323" is a report ID for a
run made on March 23, 2015. The allowed characters are: ACSII alphanumeric, '\-', '.', ',', '_', '~', and ':'.

.TP
\fB\-\-stats\fR \fI\,STATS\/\fR
Comma\-separated list of statistics to collect. The statistics are collected in parallel with measuring C\-state latency. They are stored in the the "stats" sub\-directory of the output directory. By default, only 'sysinfo' statistics are
collected. Use 'all' to collect all possible statistics. Use '\-\-stats=""' or \-\-stats='none' to disable statistics collection. If you know exactly what statistics you need, specify the comma\-separated list of statistics to collect. For
example, use 'turbostat,acpower' if you need only turbostat and AC power meter statistics. You can also specify the statistics you do not want to be collected by pre\-pending the '!' symbol. For example, 'all,!turbostat' would mean:
collect all the statistics supported by the SUT, except for 'turbostat'. Use the '\-\-list\-stats' option to get more information about available statistics. By default, only 'sysinfo' statistics are collected.

.TP
\fB\-\-stats\-intervals\fR \fI\,STATS_INTERVALS\/\fR
The intervals for statistics. Statistics collection is based on doing periodic snapshots of data. For example, by default the 'acpower' statistics collector reads SUT power consumption for the last second every second, and 'turbostat'
default interval is 5 seconds. Use 'acpower:5,turbostat:10' to increase the intervals to 5 and 10 seconds correspondingly. Use the '\-\-list\-stats' to get the default interval values.

.TP
\fB\-\-list\-stats\fR
Print information about the statistics 'wult' can collect and exit.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fI\,LDIST\/\fR, \fB\-\-ldist\fR \fI\,LDIST\/\fR
This tool works by scheduling a delayed event, then sleeping and waiting for it to happen. This step is referred to as a "measurement cycle" and it is usually repeated many times. The launch distance defines how far in the future the
delayed event is sceduled. By default this tool randomly selects launch distance within a range. The default range is [0,4ms], but you can override it with this option. Specify a comma\-separated range (e.g '\-\-ldist 10,5000'), or a
single value if you want launch distance to be precisely that value all the time. The default unit is microseconds, but you can use the following specifiers as well: ms \- milliseconds, us \- microseconds, ns \- nanoseconds. For example, '
\-\-ldist 10us,5ms' would be a [10,5000] microseconds range. Too small values may cause failures or prevent the SUT from reaching deep C\-states. If the range starts with 0, the minimum possible launch distance value allowed by the delayed
event source will be used. The optimal launch distance range is system\-specific.

.TP
\fB\-\-cpunum\fR \fI\,CPUNUM\/\fR
The logical CPU number to measure, default is CPU 0.

.TP
\fB\-\-intr\-focus\fR
Enable interrupt latency focused measurements. Most C\-states are entered using the 'mwait' instruction with interrupts disabled. When there is an interrupt, the CPU wakes up and continues running the instructions after the 'mwait'. The
CPU first runs some housekeeping code, and only then the interrupts get enabled and the CPU jumps to the interrupt handler. {OWN_NAME.title()} measures 'WakeLatency' during the "housekeeping" stage, and 'IntrLatency' is measured in the
interrupt handler. However, the 'WakeLatency' measurement takes time and affects the measured 'IntrLatency'. This option disables 'WakeLatency' measurements, which improves 'IntrLatency' measurements' accuracy.

.TP
\fB\-\-tsc\-cal\-time\fR \fI\,TSC_CAL_TIME\/\fR
Wult receives raw datapoints from the driver, then processes them, and then saves the processed datapoint in the 'datapoints.csv' file. The processing involves converting TSC cycles to microseconds, so wult needs SUT's TSC rate. TSC
rate is calculated from the datapoints, which come with TSC counters and timestamps, so TSC rate can be calculated as "delta TSC / delta timestamp". In other words, wult needs two datapoints to calculate TSC rate. However, the
datapoints have to be far enough apart, and this option defines the distance between the datapoints (in seconds). The default distance is 10 seconds, which means that wult will keep collecting and buffering datapoints for 10s without
processing them (because processing requires TSC rate to be known). After 10s, wult will start processing all the buffered datapoints, and then the newly collected datapoints. Generally, longer TSC calculation time translates to better
accuracy.

.TP
\fB\-\-keep\-raw\-data\fR
Wult receives raw datapoints from the driver, then processes them, and then saves the processed datapoint in the 'datapoints.csv' file. In order to keep the CSV file smaller, wult keeps only the esential information, and drops the rest.
For example, raw timestamps are dropped. With this option, however, wult saves all the raw data to the CSV file, along with the processed data.

.TP
\fB\-\-no\-unload\fR
This option exists for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. Please, do not use for other reasons. While normally wult kernel modules are unloaded after the measurements are done, with this option the modules will stay loaded into the
kernel. Keep in mind that if the the specified 'devid' device was bound to some driver (e.g., a network driver), it will be unbinded and with this option it won't be binded back.

.TP
\fB\-\-early\-intr\fR
This option is for research purposes and you most probably do not need it. Linux's 'cpuidle' subsystem enters most C\-states with interrupts disabled. So when the CPU exits the C\-state becaouse of an interrupt, it will not jump to the
interrupt handler, but instead, continue running some 'cpuidle' housekeeping code. After this, the 'cpuidle' subsystem enables interrupts, and the CPU jumps to the interrupt hanlder. Therefore, there is a tiny delay the 'cpuidle'
subsystem adds on top of the hardware C\-state latency. For fast C\-states like C1, this tiny delay may even be measurable on some platforms. This option allows to measure that delay. It makes wult enable interrupts before linux enters
the C\-state. This option is generally a crude option along with '\-\-intr\-focus'. When this option is used, often it makes sense to use '\-\-intr\-focus' at the same time.

.TP
\fB\-\-dirty\-cpu\-cache\fR
Deeper C\-states like Intel CPU core C6 flush the CPU cache before entering the C\-state. Therefore, the dirty CPU cache lines must be written back to the main memory before entering the C\-state. This may increase C\-state latency observed
by the operating system. If this option is used, wult will try to "dirty" the measured CPU cache before requesting C\-states. This is done by writing zeroes to a pre\-allocated 2MiB buffer.

.TP
\fB\-\-dcbuf\-size\fR \fI\,DCBUF_SIZE\/\fR
By default, in order to make CPU cache be filled with dirty cache lines, wult filles a 2MiB buffer with zeroes before requesting a C\-state. This buffer is reffered to as "dirty cache buffer", or "dcbuf". This option allows for changing
the dcbuf size. For example, in order to make it 4MiB, use '\-\-dcbuf\-size=4MiB'.

.TP
\fB\-\-offline\fR \fI\,OFFLINE\/\fR
Offline CPUs before the measurements. The possible values are: same\-core, same\-package, all. The "same\-core" value offlines all other CPUs on the same core as the measured CPU. The "same\-package" value offlines all CPUs on the same
package as the measured CPU, and the "all" value offlines all CPUs except for the measured CPU. Example: consider a hypothetical 2\-socket system with 2 cores per socket and 2 CPUs per core (e.g., hyper\-threads). The default measured CPU
is CPU0 (see '\-\-cpunum'). Suppose CPU0\-3 are on package 0, and CPU4\-7 are on package 1. Suppose CPU2 is the hyper\-thread running on the same core as CPU0. In this case '\-\-offline same\-core' would offline only CPU2, '\-\-offline same\-
package' would offline CPU1\-3, '\-\-offline all' would offline CPU1\-7. The CPUs are offlined before starting the measurements, and onlined back after the measurements.

.TP
\fB\-\-report\fR
Generate an HTML report for collected results (same as calling 'report' command with default arguments).

.TP
\fB\-\-force\fR
By default wult does not accept network card as a measurement device if its Linux network interface is in an active state, such as "up". Use '\-\-force' to disable this safety mechanism. Use '\-\-force' option with caution.

.SH OPTIONS 'wult report'
usage: wult report [-h] [-q] [-d] [-o OUTDIR] [--rfilt RFILT] [--rsel RSEL] [--even-up-dp-count] [-x XAXES] [-y YAXES] [--hist HIST] [--chist CHIST] [--reportids REPORTIDS] [--title-descr TITLE_DESCR] [--relocatable RELOCATABLE]

\fB\-o\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR, \fB\-\-outdir\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR
Path to the directory to store the report at. By default the report is stored in the 'wult\-report\-<reportid>' sub\-directory of the current working directory, where '<reportid>' is report ID of wult test result (the first one if there
are multiple).

.TP
\fB\-\-rfilt\fR \fI\,RFILT\/\fR
The row filter: remove all the rows satisfying the filter expression. Here is an example of an expression: '(WakeLatency < 10000) | (PC6% < 1)'. This row filter expression will remove all rows with 'WakeLatency' smaller than 10000
nanoseconds or package C6 residency smaller than 1%. The detailed row filter expression syntax can be found in the documentation for the 'eval()' function of Python 'pandas' module. You can use column names in the expression, or the
special word 'index' for the row number. Value '0' is the header, value '1' is the first row, and so on. For example, expression 'index >= 10' will get rid of all data rows except for the first 10 ones.

.TP
\fB\-\-rsel\fR \fI\,RSEL\/\fR
The row selector: remove all rows except for those satisfying the selector expression. In other words, the selector is just an inverse filter: '\-\-rsel expr' is the same as '\-\-rfilt "not (expr)"'.

.TP
\fB\-\-even\-up\-dp\-count\fR
Even up datapoints count before generating the report. This option is useful when generating a report for many test results (a diff). If the test results contain different count of datapoints (rows count in the CSV file), the resulting
histograms may look a little bit misleading. This option evens up datapoints count in the test results. It just finds the test result with the minimum count of datapoints and ignores the extra datapoints in the other test results.

.TP
\fB\-x\fR \fI\,XAXES\/\fR, \fB\-\-xaxes\fR \fI\,XAXES\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of CSV column names (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to use on X\-axes of the scatter plot(s), default is 'SilentTime'. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names.
Use value 'none' to disable scatter plots.

.TP
\fB\-y\fR \fI\,YAXES\/\fR, \fB\-\-yaxes\fR \fI\,YAXES\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of CSV column names (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to use on the Y\-axes for the scatter plot(s). If multiple CSV column names are specified for the X\- or Y\-axes, then the report will
include multiple scatter plots for all the X\- and Y\-axes combinations. The default is '.*Latency'. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names. se value 'none' to disable scatter plots.

.TP
\fB\-\-hist\fR \fI\,HIST\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of CSV column names (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to add a histogram for, default is '.*Latency'. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names. Use value 'none' to
disable histograms.

.TP
\fB\-\-chist\fR \fI\,CHIST\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of CSV column names (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to add a cumulative distribution for, default is 'None'. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names. Use value
'none' to disable cumulative histograms.

.TP
\fB\-\-reportids\fR \fI\,REPORTIDS\/\fR
Every input raw result comes with a report ID. This report ID is basically a short name for the test result, and it used in the HTML report to refer to the test result. However, sometimes it is helpful to temporarily override the report
IDs just for the HTML report, and this is what the '\-\-reportids' option does. Please, specify a comma\-separated list of report IDs for every input raw test result. The first report ID will be used for the first raw rest result, the
second report ID will be used for the second raw test result, and so on. Please, refer to the '\-\-reportid' option description in the 'start' command for more information about the report ID.

.TP
\fB\-\-title\-descr\fR \fI\,TITLE_DESCR\/\fR
The report title description \- any text describing this report as whole, or path to a file containing the overall report description. For example, if the report compares platform A and platform B, the description could be something like
'platform A vs B comparison'. This text will be included into the very beginning of the resulting HTML report.

.TP
\fB\-\-relocatable\fR \fI\,RELOCATABLE\/\fR
By default the generated report includes references to the raw test results, and at the file\-system level, the raw test results are symlinks pointing to the raw test results directory paths. This means that if raw test results are moved
somewhere, or the generated report is moved to another system, it may end up with broken raw results links. This option accepts 3 possible values: 'copy' and 'noraw', and 'symlink'. In case of the 'copy' value, raw results will be
copied to the report output directory, which will make the report relocatable, but in expense of increased disk space consumption. In case of the 'noraw' value, the raw results wont be referenced at all, neither in the HTML report, nor
at the file\-system level. This will also exclude the logs and the statistics. This option may be useful for minimizing the output directory disk space usage. The 'symlink' value corresponds to the default behavior.

.TP
\fB\-\-list\-columns\fR
Print the list of the available column names and exit.

.TP
\fB\-\-size\fR \fI\,REPORT_SIZE\/\fR
Generate HTML report with a pre\-defined set of diagrams and histograms. This option is mutually exclusive with '\-\-xaxes', '\-\-yaxes', '\-\-hist', '\-\-chist', therefore cannot be used in combination with any of these options. This option can
be set to 'small', 'medium' or 'large'. Here are the regular expressions for each setting: small: {XAXES='SilentTime', YAXES='.*Latency', HIST='.*Latency', CHIST='None'} medium: {XAXES='SilentTime', YAXES='.*Latency,.*Delay',
HIST='.*Latency,.*Delay', CHIST='.*Latency'} large: {XAXES='SilentTime,LDist', YAXES='.*Latency.*,.*Delay(?!Cyc).*,[PC]C.+%,SilentTime,ReqCState', HIST='.*Latency.*,.*Delay(?!Cyc).*,[PC]C.+%,SilentTime,ReqCState,LDist',

The row selector: remove all rows except for those satisfying the selector expression. In other words, the selector is just an inverse filter: '\-\-rsel expr' is the same as '\-\-rfilt "not (expr)"'.

.TP
\fB\-\-cfilt\fR \fI\,CFILT\/\fR
The columns filter: remove all column specified in the filter. The columns filter is just a comma\-separated list of the CSV file column names or python style regular expressions matching the names. For example expression
'SilentTime,WarmupDelay,.*Cyc', would remove columns 'SilentTime', 'WarmupDelay' and all columns with 'Cyc' in the column name. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names.

.TP
\fB\-\-csel\fR \fI\,CSEL\/\fR
The columns selector: remove all column except for those specified in the selector. The syntax is the same as for '\-\-cfilt'.

.TP
\fB\-\-human\-readable\fR
By default the result 'filter' command print the result as a CSV file to the standard output. This option can be used to dump the result in a more human\-readable form.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR, \fB\-\-outdir\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR
By default the resulting CSV lines are printed to the standard output. But this option can be used to specify the output directly to store the result at. This will create a filtered version of the input test result.

.TP
\fB\-\-list\-columns\fR
Print the list of the available column names and exit.

.TP
\fB\-\-reportid\fR \fI\,REPORTID\/\fR
Report ID of the filtered version of the result (can only be used with '\-\-outdir').

.SH OPTIONS 'wult calc'
usage: wult calc [-h] [-q] [-d] [--rfilt RFILT] [--rsel RSEL] [--cfilt CFILT] [--csel CSEL] [-f FUNCS] [--list-funcs] respath

Calculates various summary functions for a wult test result (e.g., the median value for one of the CSV columns).

.TP
\fBrespath\fR
The wult test result path to calculate summary functions for.

\fB\-\-rfilt\fR \fI\,RFILT\/\fR
The row filter: remove all the rows satisfying the filter expression. Here is an example of an expression: '(WakeLatency < 10000) | (PC6% < 1)'. This row filter expression will remove all rows with 'WakeLatency' smaller than 10000
nanoseconds or package C6 residency smaller than 1%. The detailed row filter expression syntax can be found in the documentation for the 'eval()' function of Python 'pandas' module. You can use column names in the expression, or the
special word 'index' for the row number. Value '0' is the header, value '1' is the first row, and so on. For example, expression 'index >= 10' will get rid of all data rows except for the first 10 ones.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fI\,FUNCS\/\fR, \fB\-\-funcs\fR \fI\,FUNCS\/\fR
Comma\-separated list of summary functions to calculate. By default all generally interesting functions are calculated (each column name is associated with a list of functions that make sense for this column). Use '\-\-list\-funcs' to get
the list of supported functions.

.TP
\fB\-\-list\-funcs\fR
Print the list of the available summary functions.
