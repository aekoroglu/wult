.SH COMMAND \fI\,'ndl deploy'\/\fR
usage: ndl deploy [-h] [-q] [-d] [--kernel-src KSRC] [-H HOSTNAME] [-U USERNAME] [-K PRIVKEY] [-T TIMEOUT]

Compile and deploy ndl helpers and drivers to the SUT (System Under Test), which can be either local or a remote host, depending on the '\-H' option.The drivers are searched for in the following directories (and in the following order) on the local host: /usr/bin/drivers/idle, $NDL_DATA_PATH/drivers/idle (if 'NDL_DATA_PATH' environment variable is defined), $HOME/.local/share/wult/drivers/idle, /usr/local/share/wult/drivers/idle, /usr/share/wult/drivers/idle.The ndl tool also depends on the following helpers: ndlrunner. These helpers will be compiled on the SUT and deployed to the SUT. The sources of the helpers are searched for in the following paths (and in the following order) on the local host: /usr/bin/helpers, $NDL_DATA_PATH/helpers (if 'NDL_DATA_PATH' environment variable is defined), $HOME/.local/share/wult/helpers, /usr/local/share/wult/helpers, /usr/share/wult/helpers. By default, helpers are deployed to the path defined by the NDL_HELPERSPATH environment variable. If the variable is not defined, helpers are deployed to '$HOME/.local/bin', where '$HOME' is the home directory of user 'USERNAME' on host 'HOST' (see '\-\-host' and '\-\-username' options).

SSH connect timeout in seconds, default is 8.

.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fI\,COUNT\/\fR, \fB\-\-datapoints\fR \fI\,COUNT\/\fR
How many datapoints should the test result include, default is 1000000. Note, unless the '\-\-start\-over' option is used, the pre\-existing datapoints are taken into account. For example, if the test result already has 6000 datapoints and
'\-c 10000' is used, the tool will collect 4000 datapoints and exit. Warning: collecting too many datapoints may result in a very large test result file, which will be difficult to process later, because that would require a lot of
memory.

.TP
\fB\-\-time\-limit\fR \fI\,LIMIT\/\fR
The measurement time limit, i.e., for how long the SUT should be measured. The default unit is minutes, but you can use the following handy specifiers as well: d \- days, h \- hours, m \- minutes, s \- seconds. For example '1h25m' would be
1 hour and 25 minutes, or 10m5s would be 10 minutes and 5 seconds. Value '0' means "no time limit", and this is the default. If this option is used along with the '\-\-datapoints' option, then measurements will stop as when either the
time limit is reached, or the required amount of datapoints is collected.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR, \fB\-\-outdir\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR
Path to the directory to store the results at.

.TP
\fB\-\-reportid\fR \fI\,REPORTID\/\fR
Any string which may serve as an identifier of this run. By default report ID is the current date, prefixed with the remote host name in case the '\-H' option was used: [hostname\-]YYYYMMDD. For example, "20150323" is a report ID for a
run made on March 23, 2015. The allowed characters are: ACSII alphanumeric, '\-', '.', ',', '_', and '~'.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fI\,LDIST\/\fR, \fB\-\-ldist\fR \fI\,LDIST\/\fR
The launch distance in microseconds. This tool works by scheduling a delayed network packet, then sleeping and waiting for the packet to be sent. This step is referred to as a "measurement cycle" and it is usually repeated many times.
The launch distance defines how far in the future the delayed network packets are scheduled. By default this tool randomly selects launch distance in range of [5000, 50000] microseconds (same as '\-\-ldist 5000,50000'). Specify a comma\-
separated range or a single value if you want launch distance to be precisely that value all the time. The default unit is microseconds, but you can use the following specifiers as well: ms \- milliseconds, us \- microseconds, ns \-
nanoseconds. For example, '\-\-ldist 500us,100ms' would be a [500,100000] microseconds range. Note, too low values may cause failures or prevent the SUT from reaching deep C\-states. The optimal value is system\-specific.

.TP
\fB\-\-rfilt\fR \fI\,RFILT\/\fR
The row filter: remove all the rows satisfying the filter expression. Here is an example of an expression: '(WakeLatency < 10000) | (PC6% < 1)'. This row filter expression will remove all rows with 'WakeLatency' smaller than 10000
nanoseconds or package C6 residency smaller than 1%. You can use any column names in the expression.

.TP
\fB\-\-rsel\fR \fI\,RSEL\/\fR
The row selector: remove all rows except for those satisfying the selector expression. In other words, the selector is just an inverse filter: '\-\-rsel expr' is the same as '\-\-rfilt "not (expr)"'.

.TP
\fB\-\-keep\-filtered\fR
If the '\-\-rfilt' / '\-\-rsel' options are used, then the datapoints not matching the selector or matching the filter are discarded. This is the default behavior which can be changed with this option. If '\-\-keep\-filtered' has been
specified, then all datapoints are saved in result. Here is an example. Suppose you want to collect 100000 datapoints where RTD is greater than 50 microseconds. In this case, you can use these options: \-c 100000 \-\-rfilt="RTD > 50". The
result will contain 100000 datapoints, all of them will have RTD bigger than 50 microseconds. But what if you do not want to simply discard the other datapoints, because they are also interesting? Well, add the '\-\-keep\-filtered' option.
The result will contain, say, 150000 datapoints, 100000 of which will have RTD value greater than 50.

.TP
\fB\-\-report\fR
Generate an HTML report for collected results (same as calling 'report' command with default arguments).

.SH COMMAND \fI\,'ndl report'\/\fR
usage: ndl report [-h] [-q] [-d] [-o OUTDIR] [--rfilt RFILT] [--rsel RSEL] [--even-up-dp-count] [-x XAXES] [-y YAXES] [--hist HIST] [--chist CHIST] [--reportids REPORTIDS] [--title-descr TITLE_DESCR] [--relocatable RELOCATABLE]
                  [--list-columns]
                  respaths [respaths ...]

Create an HTML report for one or multiple test results.

.TP
\fBrespaths\fR

.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Print debugging information.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR, \fB\-\-outdir\fR \fI\,OUTDIR\/\fR
Path to the directory to store the report at. By default the report is stored in the 'ndl\-report\-<reportid>' sub\-directory of the current working directory, where '<reportid>' is report ID of ndl test result (the first one if there are
multiple).

.TP
\fB\-\-rfilt\fR \fI\,RFILT\/\fR
The row filter: remove all the rows satisfying the filter expression. Here is an example of an expression: '(WakeLatency < 10000) | (PC6% < 1)'. This row filter expression will remove all rows with 'WakeLatency' smaller than 10000
nanoseconds or package C6 residency smaller than 1%. The detailed row filter expression syntax can be found in the documentation for the 'eval()' function of Python 'pandas' module. You can use column names in the expression, or the
special word 'index' for the row number. Value '0' is the header, value '1' is the first row, and so on. For example, expression 'index >= 10' will get rid of all data rows except for the first 10 ones.

.TP
\fB\-\-rsel\fR \fI\,RSEL\/\fR
The row selector: remove all rows except for those satisfying the selector expression. In other words, the selector is just an inverse filter: '\-\-rsel expr' is the same as '\-\-rfilt "not (expr)"'.

.TP
\fB\-\-even\-up\-dp\-count\fR
Even up datapoints count before generating the report. This option is useful when generating a report for many test results (a diff). If the test results contain different count of datapoints (rows count in the CSV file), the resulting
histograms may look a little bit misleading. This option evens up datapoints count in the test results. It just finds the test result with the minimum count of datapoints and ignores the extra datapoints in the other test results.

.TP
\fB\-x\fR \fI\,XAXES\/\fR, \fB\-\-xaxes\fR \fI\,XAXES\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of CSV column names (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to use on X\-axes of the scatter plot(s), default is 'LDist'. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names. Use
value 'none' to disable scatter plots.

.TP
\fB\-y\fR \fI\,YAXES\/\fR, \fB\-\-yaxes\fR \fI\,YAXES\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of CSV column names (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to use on the Y\-axes for the scatter plot(s). If multiple CSV column names are specified for the X\- or Y\-axes, then the report will
include multiple scatter plots for all the X\- and Y\-axes combinations. The default is 'RTD'. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names. se value 'none' to disable scatter plots.

.TP
\fB\-\-hist\fR \fI\,HIST\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of CSV column names (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to add a histogram for, default is 'RTD'. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names. Use value 'none' to
disable histograms.

.TP
\fB\-\-chist\fR \fI\,CHIST\/\fR
A comma\-separated list of CSV column names (or python style regular expressions matching the names) to add a cumulative distribution for, default is 'RTD'. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names. Use value
'none' to disable cumulative histograms.

.TP
\fB\-\-reportids\fR \fI\,REPORTIDS\/\fR
Every input raw result comes with a report ID. This report ID is basically a short name for the test result, and it used in the HTML report to refer to the test result. However, sometimes it is helpful to temporarily override the report
IDs just for the HTML report, and this is what the '\-\-reportids' option does. Please, specify a comma\-separated list of report IDs for every input raw test result. The first report ID will be used for the first raw rest result, the
second report ID will be used for the second raw test result, and so on. Please, refer to the '\-\-reportid' option description in the 'start' command for more information about the report ID.

.TP
\fB\-\-title\-descr\fR \fI\,TITLE_DESCR\/\fR
The report title description \- any text describing this report as whole, or path to a file containing the overall report description. For example, if the report compares platform A and platform B, the description could be something like
'platform A vs B comparison'. This text will be included into the very beginning of the resulting HTML report.

.TP
\fB\-\-relocatable\fR \fI\,RELOCATABLE\/\fR
By default the generated report includes references to the raw test results, and at the file\-system level, the raw test results are symlinks pointing to the raw test results directory paths. This means that if raw test results are moved
somewhere, or the generated report is moved to another system, it may end up with broken raw results links. This option accepts 3 possible values: 'copy' and 'noraw', and 'symlink'. In case of the 'copy' value, raw results will be
copied to the report output directory, which will make the report relocatable, but in expense of increased disk space consumption. In case of the 'noraw' value, the raw results wont be referenced at all, neither in the HTML report, nor
at the file\-system level. This will also exclude the logs and the statistics. This option may be useful for minimizing the output directory disk space usage. The 'symlink' value corresponds to the default behavior.

.TP
\fB\-\-list\-columns\fR
Print the list of the available column names and exit.

.SH COMMAND \fI\,'ndl filter'\/\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-cfilt\fR \fI\,CFILT\/\fR
The columns filter: remove all column specified in the filter. The columns filter is just a comma\-separated list of the CSV file column names or python style regular expressions matching the names. For example expression
'SilentTime,WarmupDelay,.*Cyc', would remove columns 'SilentTime', 'WarmupDelay' and all columns with 'Cyc' in the column name. Use '\-\-list\-columns' to get the list of the available column names.

.TP
