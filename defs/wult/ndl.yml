    title: "Round Trip Delay"
    descr: >-
        This is time it takes the I210 PCIe device to read 64-bytes from the host memory. This time
        is measured by the Intel I210 network card - every time it reads data from the host memory,
        to performs 64-byte DMA transaction over the PCIe link, and measures every transaction's
        delay.  The longest transaction is then stored in the RR2DCDELAY register (stands for "Read
        Request To Data Completion Delay"). This register is zeroed every time it is read, so it
        contains the longs DMA transaction delay since the last read. Ndl just periodically
        schedules delayed network packets, let the system be idle just waiting for the I210 to
        handle the delayed packets. When I210 starts handling the delayed packet, it will be reading
        packet data form memory and measure the read transactions' delays. If at that time the host
        is in a deep C-state, the first transaction will wake it up and will be the longest
        transaction, and its delay will be available in the RR2DCDELAY register. Ndl reads
        this register, stores the read value as "RTD" (easier to pronounce), and repeats the
        experiment.
