Busy%:
    title: "Busy%"
    descr: >-
        The proportion of time spent in a busy state, as opposed to an idle state. In other words,
        this is the C0 state residency.
    unit: "%"
    short_unit: "%"
    default_funcs: ["99.999%", "99.99%", "99.9%", "99%", "max", "min", "med", "avg", "std"]
Bzy_MHz:
    title: "Bzy_MHz"
    descr: >-
        The average CPU frequency in C0 state (C0 state is the state when the CPU executes
        instructions, as opposed to an idle state, where the CPU does not execute instructions).
    unit: "megahertz"
    short_unit: "MHz"
    default_funcs: ["99.999%", "99.99%", "99.9%", "99%", "max", "min", "med", "avg", "std"]
Avg_MHz:
    title: "Avg_MHz"
    descr: >-
        The average CPU frequency. Includes both idle and non-idle periods.
    unit: "megahertz"
    short_unit: "MHz"
    default_funcs: ["99.999%", "99.99%", "99.9%", "99%", "max", "min", "med", "avg", "std"]
CPU%cx:
    title: "CPU%cx"
    descr: >-
        The percentage of time spent in the ccx hardware C-state.
    type: "float"
    unit: "%"
    short_unit: "%"
    default_funcs: ["99.999%", "99.99%", "99.9%", "99%", "max", "min", "med", "avg", "std"]
    drop_empty: True
Cx%:
    title: "Cx%"
    descr: >-
        The percentage of time spent in the Cx requestable C-state. Note, this number does not come
        from the hardware, it is calculated by the operating system.
    type: "float"
    unit: "%"
    short_unit: "%"
    default_funcs: ["99.999%", "99.99%", "99.9%", "99%", "max", "min", "med", "avg", "std"]

Time:
    title: "Time Elapsed"
    descr: "Time elapsed since the start of the measurements."
    unit: "second"
    short_unit: "s"
