Busy%:
    title: "Busy percent"
    descr: >-
        The proportion of time spent in a busy state, as opposed to an idle state. In other words,
        this is the C0 state residency. Retrieved from the "Busy%" turbostat column.
    unit: "%"
    short_unit: "%"
    default_funcs: ["99.999%", "99.99%", "99.9%", "99%", "max", "min", "med", "avg", "std"]
Bzy_MHz:
    title: "Busy frequency"
    descr: >-
        The average CPU frequency in C0 state (C0 state is the state when the CPU executes
        instructions, as opposed to an idle state, where the CPU does not execute instructions).
        Retrieved from the "Bzy_MHz" turbostat column.
    unit: "megahertz"
    short_unit: "MHz"
    default_funcs: ["99.999%", "99.99%", "99.9%", "99%", "max", "min", "med", "avg", "std"]
Avg_MHz:
    title: "Average frequency"
    descr: >-
        The average CPU frequency. Includes both idle and non-idle periods. Retrieved from the
        "Avg_MHz" turbostat column.
    unit: "megahertz"
    short_unit: "MHz"
    default_funcs: ["99.999%", "99.99%", "99.9%", "99%", "max", "min", "med", "avg", "std"]
CPU%cx:
    title: "ccx core C-state residency"
    descr: >-
        The percentage of time spent in the ccx hardware C-state. Retrieved from the "CPU%cx"
        turbostat column.
    type: "float"
    unit: "%"
    short_unit: "%"
    default_funcs: ["99.999%", "99.99%", "99.9%", "99%", "max", "min", "med", "avg", "std"]
    drop_empty: True
Cx%:
    title: "Cx requested percent"
    descr: >-
        The percentage of time spent in the Cx requestable C-state. Note, this number does not come
        from the hardware, it is calculated by the operating system. Retrieved from the "Cx%"
        turbostat column.
    type: "float"
    unit: "%"
    short_unit: "%"
    default_funcs: ["99.999%", "99.99%", "99.9%", "99%", "max", "min", "med", "avg", "std"]
    drop_empty: True
CorWatt:
    title: "Core power"
    descr: >-
        CPU core power. Measured using the core RAPL domain. Retrieved from the "CorWatt" turbostat
        column.
    type: "float"
    unit: "Watt"
    short_unit: "W"
    default_funcs: ["99.999%", "99.99%", "99.9%", "99%", "max", "min", "med", "avg", "std"]
PkgWatt:
    title: "Package power"
    descr: >-
        Package power. Measured using the core RAPL domain. Retrieved from the "PkgWatt" turbostat
        column.

GFXWatt:
    title: "Graphics power"
    descr: >-
        Graphics power. Measured using the GPU RAPL domain. Retrieved from the "GFXWatt" turbostat
        column.
    type: "float"

    default_funcs: ["99.999%", "99.99%", "99.9%", "99%", "max", "min", "med", "avg", "std"]
Time:
    title: "Time Elapsed"
    descr: >-
        Time elapsed since the start of the measurements. Derived from the "Time_Of_Day_Seconds"
        turbostat column.
