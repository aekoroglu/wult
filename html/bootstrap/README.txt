# Upgrading Bootstrap Version
In order to upgrade the Bootstrap version follow the following steps:
 1. Update the Bootstrap source files in the JS and CSS directories.
 2. Update the license ('bootstrap/LICENSE') to reflect the version you are upgrading to.
 3. Update the CDN HTML template in 'templates/bootstrap_cdn.html'. This is the
    HTML required to load the Bootstrap assets remotely if they are not available
    locally.
 4. Update the version number in this README.
